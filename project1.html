        <h1>Bound & Pound</h1>
        <p>
            Bound & Pound is a seven level game inspired by classic titles such as Breakout and Arkanoid!
            Fight through the tiles arsenal with classic and unique powerups such as the fireball, multiball and even radiation?!
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was made in my free time using Unity, C# and Aseprite.
            The menu is interactive allowing all of the menu buttons to be affected by the ball,
             including the game title which will break down when the player is on the menu screen!
            Levels are shown to the player in a pseudorandom order with a final boss stage to complete.
            It even uses a built-in leaderboard created by <a href="https://danqzq.itch.io/leaderboard-creator">Danial Jumagaliyev</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Find the game <a href="https://merlinthewizard1313.itch.io">here</a> on my itch page. I hope you enjoy!
