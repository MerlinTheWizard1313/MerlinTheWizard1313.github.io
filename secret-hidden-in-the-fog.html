        It's you, you either have the most insane luck imaginable or you were one smart cookie.
        Either way, thank you for taking part in the ARG I made. I really enjoyed putting this together and hope you enjoyed playing it.
        I want to do more things like this for sure, just need the time to do it! 
        If you liked it, I will be sure to update the webpage with anything new in the projects page.

        Special Thanks to Joe and Michael, who are some of the best mates I have. 
        If it weren't for them, this would never have existed. 
        James and Jess who let me ramble about the ARG behind the scenes. 
        James, particularly, helped me with inspiration for a puzzle in part 3! 
        Sadly no meowth to that combo here. And lastly, thank you for taking part!

        You will never achieve greatness, if you never take the first leap
