        <h1>Xtreme Noughts and Crosses</h1>
        <div class="rules"></div>
        <div class="rules-box"> How to Play: On your turn (depicted by the current turn pointer), 
            you pick a grid square that is highlighted in your colour to make an X in that square,
            just like original noughts and crosses or tictactoe.

            However, now you send your opponent into the grid square that corresponds to your move.
            So if my first move is in the center square, it will send my opponent to the center board!

            If you happen to complete the first row in a board, you claim that board.
            Similar to the nine smaller boards, the large board is now 1/3 in your grasp,
            so aim for a row in the big board.

            You will win by either getting a row in the big board, 
            or by having the most won boards by the end of the game. 

            In the case that both you and the opponent claim the same amount of wins on the big board,
            lets say four wins each, and there is no winning rows after every move is made, each board will be evaluated.
            In a non winning board, if you made more moves than your opponent, you win that board square and hence win the match!

            It sounds complicated but it will make sense once you give it a try!

            Oh and one final note, if you send your opponent to a board where no move is possible, 
            they get to choose any board to make a move in and vice versa. 
            Sending your opponent to the same board every time eventually comes back to bite you!

            Hope you have fun!
