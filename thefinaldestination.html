        You did it! You strived through trials and tribulations! I congratulate you. 
        I hereby decree that you will be named an honourary knight of the round table, 
        for your valiant puzzle solving and intrepid determination. The fisher king will indeed be saved! 
        Now, I must be off, maybe you will find me in the future? 
        Maybe there was something you missed on your adventure 
        *winks at you and poofs away in a puff of smoke*
